# Appium automation demo project

In this project, I used Serenity framework + Junit library + Appium framework to write the script.

I also recorded the video when running the script on my machine.

The script was failed because we cannot find products/items after submitting  to Carousell.
Even I refresh manually many times.

Thanks for reading this and viewing my code.
